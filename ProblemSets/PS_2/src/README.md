# Source Directory: `/src`

This directory contains the source files for the CS279 Problem Set 2.

## Files

- **`makefile`**: The build file used to compile the source code in this directory.
- **`PS_2.cpp`**: Main source file containing the solution logic for Problem Set 2.

## Building the Source Code

To compile the source code and produce the necessary object files, navigate to the `/src` directory and run:

```bash
make all
```

This will compile the `PS_2.cpp` source file and generate the corresponding object file in the `/lib` directory.

## Usage

The source code in `PS_2.cpp` defines the core functionality required for the problem set. To utilize the functions and classes defined here, ensure that the appropriate headers from the `/inc` directory are included.

## Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed before compiling.
- If modifications are made to the source file or if there are additional source files added, make sure to update the `makefile` accordingly.

## Contributing

For modifications, suggestions, or feature additions, please refer to the main repository's guidelines or discuss with the project maintainers.
