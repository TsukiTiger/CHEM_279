# `/test` Directory

Welcome to the `test` directory!

## Overview

The `test` directory is designated for housing unit and integration tests for the project. Testing is a fundamental component of software development that guarantees the functionality and reliability of the codebase. In this directory, you will find unit tests, focusing on individual components, and integrated tests that focus on the interactions between components.

## Directory Contents

- **`makefile`**: A makefile script that facilitates the automation of building and running tests in this directory. Executing the `make` command in this directory will compile and run the tests as per the instructions in this makefile.

- **`test.cpp`**: This file contains both unit and integrated tests for the project. Unit tests verify the behavior of individual functions or classes in isolation, ensuring that each component operates as expected. Integrated tests aim to ascertain that different components of the software interact as intended, confirming the overall functionality of the system.

## Usage

1. **Compiling and Running Tests**: To compile and run tests, navigate to the `test` directory in your terminal and execute the `make` command. The `makefile` will handle the compilation and execution of the test files.

2. **Adding New Tests**: While expanding the project and adding more functionality, ensure to add corresponding tests. New unit tests can be added to `test.cpp`, ensuring that new and modified components are verified.

3. **Review Test Results**: Post execution of the tests, review the output in the console to identify any failures or errors. Address any issues encountered to maintain the robustness and reliability of the codebase.

## Best Practices

- **Regular Testing**: Ensure to run tests regularly after making modifications to the codebase. This practice helps in early identification and resolution of issues and maintains the reliability of the software.

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Strive for extensive test coverage. Test all critical paths and edge cases, even though covering every possible scenario is challenging.

- **Documentation**: Document your tests comprehensively, outlining the purpose and expected outcome of each test. Clear documentation facilitates better understanding and maintenance of the testing suite, especially for collaborative projects.

- **Isolate Issues**: In case of a test failure, use the output to identify the issue and rectify the root cause promptly.

## Conclusion

Maintaining a regular and rigorous testing regime is crucial for ensuring the robustness and functionality of the software. The `test` directory is structured to accommodate and organize testing efforts effectively. For questions or assistance related to testing procedures, refer to the main project documentation or consult with the project's maintainers.
