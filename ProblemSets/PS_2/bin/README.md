# `/bin` Directory

Welcome to the `bin` directory!

## Overview

The `bin` directory is designated for storing executable files generated from the source code. It is intended to keep the build artifacts separate from the source code, making the project structure cleaner and easier to manage.

## Structure

Currently, this directory should be empty as no executables have been generated yet. As you compile and build your project, the generated executables will reside here.

## Usage

1. **Building the Project**: When you compile and build your source code (usually residing in the `src` or `test` directory), direct the build system to place the resulting executable files in this `bin` directory.

2. **Running Executables**: Navigate to the `bin` directory to run your executables. Depending on the build system and platform, you might execute them directly from here, or you might use a command-line interface.

## Keeping `bin` Clean

It's a good practice to occasionally clean the `bin` directory, especially when you're making significant changes to your codebase or changing compilation flags. This ensures that old and potentially incompatible executables are removed.

Many build systems and environments provide a "clean" command that removes built artifacts, and it typically clears out the contents of directories like `bin`.

## Notes

- Do not commit executables to version control (e.g., Git). It's standard practice to add the `bin` directory to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits of executables.

- By separating source code from built executables, you reduce the risk of accidental source code modifications and provide a clear distinction between development and runtime components.

If you have any questions or concerns about the usage of this directory, please refer to the main project documentation or consult the project maintainers.
