To extend your Huckel code and implement gradients based on Voityuk's paper, you can divide the work into two parts: extending the Huckel Theory (HT) and implementing the gradient calculations. Below is a plan structured over two parts with references to the original material for guidance.

### Part 1: Extend Huckel Theory

#### Day 1: Understanding and Planning
1. **Read and Understand Voityuk's Paper:**
    - Focus on sections discussing the repulsion correction and Hamiltonian matrix construction (Ref: eht_updated_jctc_2008.pdf, L686-L692, L888-L895).

2. **Plan Code Modifications:**
    - Identify code sections where the Hamiltonian is constructed and modify them to align with the MTB/2 method.
    - Plan how to integrate the repulsion correction terms into your energy calculations.

#### Day 2: Implementing Modifications
3. **Code Development:**
    - Implement the new Hamiltonian matrix elements as described in the paper.
    - Include the repulsion correction terms in the energy calculations.

4. **Initial Testing:**
    - Test the modified code with simple hydrocarbons to ensure the new terms are correctly implemented.

### Part 2: Implement Gradient Calculations

#### Day 3: Gradient Theory and Initial Coding
5. **Understand Gradient Calculations:**
    - Review computational methods for gradient calculations in molecular systems (Ref: eht_updated_jctc_2008.pdf, L1986-L1998).

6. **Develop Gradient Calculation Method:**
    - Start coding the gradient calculation method.
    - Focus on calculating partial derivatives of energy with respect to atomic positions.

#### Day 4: Testing and Comparison
7. **Complete Gradient Implementation:**
    - Finalize the gradient calculation method.
    - Ensure it aligns with the computational efficiency discussed in the paper.

8. **Test and Compare:**
    - Test the updated code with gradient calculations on various hydrocarbons.
    - Compare results (structures and energies) with CNDO/2 code and experimental data (Ref: eht_updated_jctc_2008.pdf, L1386-L1408, L1681-L1689).

#### Additional Points
- **Documentation:** Throughout the process, document your code changes, the rationale behind them, and any observations from testing.
- **Review and Refine:** After initial testing, review the results and refine your code as needed to improve accuracy and efficiency.
- **Consultation and Research:** If you encounter challenges or discrepancies, consult additional literature or seek expert advice to ensure accurate implementation.

By following this plan, you will systematically extend the Huckel Theory based on Voityuk's paper and implement gradient calculations, enhancing the accuracy and applicability of your computational models for hydrocarbons.
