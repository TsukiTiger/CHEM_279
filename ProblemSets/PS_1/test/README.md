# `/test` Directory

Welcome to the `test` directory!

## Overview

The `test` directory is dedicated to housing the unit and integration tests for the project. Testing is a fundamental aspect of software development to ensure the functionality and reliability of the codebase. Here, you will find both unit tests (focused on individual components) and integrated tests (focused on the interactions between components).

## Directory Contents

- `makefile`: A specialized script to automate the building and running of tests. Using the `make` command in this directory will follow the instructions in this file to compile and execute the tests.

- `test_unit.cpp`: Contains unit tests for the project. These tests focus on verifying the behavior of individual functions or classes in isolation, ensuring that each component works correctly on its own.

- `test_integrated.cpp`: Contains integrated tests for the project. Integrated tests aim to verify that different components of the software work correctly when combined, ensuring the correct interaction and overall functionality of the system.

## Usage

1. **Compiling and Running Tests**: Navigate to the `test` directory in your terminal and run the `make` command. This will use the `makefile` to compile and execute the test files.

2. **Adding New Tests**: As you expand the project and add more functionality, it's essential to also add corresponding tests. You can add new unit tests to `test_unit.cpp` and new integrated tests to `test_integrated.cpp`.

3. **Review Test Results**: After executing the tests, review the output to check for any failures or errors. Address any issues that arise to maintain a robust and reliable codebase.

## Best Practices

- **Regular Testing**: Always run tests after making changes to the codebase. This helps in identifying issues early and ensures the reliability of the software.

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive test coverage. While it's challenging to cover every possible scenario, try to test all critical paths and edge cases.

- **Documentation**: Comment your tests clearly, explaining what each test does and what its expected outcome is. This makes it easier for others (and your future self) to understand the testing suite.

- **Isolate Issues**: If a test fails, use the provided output to pinpoint the problematic component and address the root cause.

## Conclusion

Regular testing is vital for maintaining the integrity and functionality of the software. This `test` directory provides a structured space for these testing efforts. If you have questions or need assistance with testing procedures, consider referring to the main project documentation or consulting with the project's maintainers.
