# `/test` Directory

Welcome to the `/test` directory of the CS279 Problem Set 4!

## Overview

The `/test` directory is dedicated to housing the test scripts for the project. These tests play a vital role in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the software developed in this problem set.

## Directory Contents

- **`makefile`**: A script to facilitate the automated compilation and execution of test cases. Utilize this makefile to streamline the testing process.

- **`test.cpp`**: The primary test file that contains various unit and integration tests. It is designed to rigorously test the functionality of different components of the project.

- **`README.md`**: This file, providing detailed information about the test directory, its contents, and instructions for use.

## Usage

1. **Compiling and Running Tests**: To run the tests, navigate to the `/test` directory in your terminal. Execute the command `make` to compile and execute the test cases as defined in the makefile.

2. **Adding New Tests**: When extending or modifying the project, it is important to correspondingly update or add new tests. This ensures that all new features and changes are thoroughly vetted for correctness and stability.

3. **Interpreting Test Results**: After running the tests, carefully review the outputs for any errors or failures. Address these issues promptly to maintain the integrity and reliability of the code.

## Best Practices

- **Regular Testing**: Ensure to run tests regularly, especially after making changes to the code. This practice helps in early detection and resolution of issues.

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Strive to cover as many scenarios as possible, including edge cases, in your tests. While achieving 100% coverage is challenging, extensive coverage significantly enhances the robustness of the software.

- **Clear Documentation**: Document each test clearly, stating its purpose and expected outcomes. This enhances the understandability and maintainability of the tests, particularly in collaborative settings.

- **Isolation of Failures**: In case of test failures, use the results to efficiently identify and correct the underlying issues.

## Conclusion

Effective and thorough testing is crucial for the development of reliable and robust software. This `/test` directory provides the necessary structure and resources to support your testing efforts.
