# `/inc` Directory

Welcome to the `/inc` directory for the CS279 Problem Set 4!

## Overview

The `inc` directory is an essential part of our project structure, hosting all the header files. These files play a vital role in defining the interface of various components of our application, including function declarations, class definitions, and other important constructs. They are key to promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability within the codebase.

## Structure

Within this directory, you'll find header files corresponding to different aspects of the project, including:

- **`molecule.h`**: Contains the declaration of the `Molecule` class and its associated functions. It provides the framework for representing molecular structures within the project.
- **`CNDO.h`**: Defines the structure and methods for the Complete Neglect of Differential Overlap (CNDO) calculations, a key component in our quantum chemistry simulations.

## Usage

### Including Headers
To use these headers in your `.cpp` source files, include them at the beginning of your file:
```cpp
#include "molecule.h"
#include "CNDO.h"
```

### Extending Functionality
As the project evolves, additional headers may be introduced. Ensure all new header files are placed in this directory for consistency and easy management.

### Consistency and Clarity
Uniform naming conventions and a consistent coding style should be maintained across all header files. Clear, comprehensive commenting and documentation are crucial for understanding and future maintenance.

## Best Practices

- **Use of Header Guards**: Implement header guards in each header file to prevent multiple inclusions and potential issues during compilation.
- **Documentation**: Each header file should be well-documented to explain its purpose and how its components should be used.
- **Minimizing Dependencies**: Aim to reduce interdependencies among header files to avoid complex and circular dependencies, facilitating smoother compilation.

## Notes

- Header files generally contain declarations, not definitions, to prevent linking issues during the build process.
- Regularly review and update these header files to align with the latest developments and requirements of the project.

For further information or assistance regarding the use and management of header files, refer to the main project documentation or contact the project maintainers.
