# `/bin` Directory

Welcome to the `bin` directory of our project!

## Overview

The `bin` directory is a critical component of our project structure, dedicated to storing executable files generated from the project's source code. By segregating these executables from the source files, we maintain a clean and organized project environment, facilitating easier management and navigation.

## Structure

Initially, this directory might be empty. However, it becomes populated with executable files following the compilation of your project. For this specific project, you will find:

- **`test`**: This is the primary executable generated for running tests associated with the project. It includes both unit and integration tests, crucial for ensuring the correctness and stability of the project's functionalities.

## Usage

1. **Building the Project**: When compiling the project's source code, typically done in the `src` or `test` directories, configure your build tools to direct the resulting executable files into this `bin` directory.

2. **Running the Executable**: To execute the `test` program, navigate to this directory. You can then run the `test` executable directly from here. The execution is generally performed through a command-line interface, in accordance with your system setup and build preferences.

## Best Practices for Managing `bin`

- **Regular Cleaning**: To keep the `bin` directory free of outdated or unnecessary executables, especially after significant code modifications or build configuration changes, it's recommended to perform regular cleaning. Most build systems provide a "clean" command that automates this process.

- **Version Control Practices**: It's a good practice not to commit executable files to version control systems like Git. To prevent these files from being uploaded, include the `bin` directory in the project's `.gitignore` file.

- **Separation of Source and Executable Files**: Maintaining a distinct separation between source code and executable files helps in reducing the risk of unintended source code alterations and clearly demarcates development from runtime environments.
