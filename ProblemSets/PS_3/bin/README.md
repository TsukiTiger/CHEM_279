# `/bin` Directory

Welcome to the `bin` directory!

## Overview

The `bin` directory is specifically set aside for storing executable files created from your project's source code. This approach helps in segregating the compiled executables from the source files, ensuring a tidier and more manageable project structure.

## Structure

This directory is initially empty but will house executable files once you compile and build your project. Notably, it will temporarily store the executables for `test` and `energy_diff` as part of your development and testing phases.

## Usage

1. **Building the Project**: During the compilation process (usually executed in the `src` or `test` directories), configure your build system to output the resulting executable files into this `bin` directory.

2. **Running Executables**: To run the executables (`test` and `energy_diff`), you should navigate to this directory. The execution can be done directly within this directory or through a command-line interface, depending on your setup and build system.

## Keeping `bin` Clean

It's important to maintain a clean `bin` directory, particularly when implementing major changes in your code or adjusting compilation settings. Regular cleaning ensures the removal of outdated or incompatible executable files. Most build systems offer a "clean" functionality to delete these artifacts, which typically cleans up directories like `bin`.

## Notes

- **Version Control**: Avoid committing executable files to version control systems like Git. It's advisable to include the `bin` directory in your `.gitignore` file to prevent such files from being uploaded unintentionally.

- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeping a clear separation between your source code and executable files reduces the chances of accidental modifications to your source code and delineates development from runtime environments.

For any further questions or guidance on utilizing the `bin` directory, please consult the main project documentation or reach out to the project maintainers.
