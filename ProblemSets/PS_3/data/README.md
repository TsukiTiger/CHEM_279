# Problem Set 3: Data Directory

Welcome to the data directory for Problem Set 3! This directory plays a crucial role, containing the necessary data files for exercises and tasks in your assignment. These files serve as inputs and references, providing critical information for the algorithms and implementations you will develop and test.

## Directory Contents

In this directory, you will find the following files:

- **`C2H2.out`**: An output data file with information on the C2H2 (acetylene) molecule.
- **`C2H2.txt`**: A text file containing configurations or data relevant to the C2H2 molecule.
- **`C2H4.out`**: This file includes output data regarding the C2H4 (ethylene) molecule.
- **`C2H4.txt`**: Provides text data and parameters for the C2H4 molecule.
- **`H2.out`**: An output file with details on the H2 (hydrogen) molecule.
- **`H2.txt`**: Contains text information or settings specific to the H2 molecule.
- **`README.md`**: The current file, explaining the data directory's contents and usage guidelines.

## Contributing Data

If you wish to add or modify data files, please ensure to follow the established format. Keeping the format consistent is crucial for the smooth functioning of algorithms that process these files. Changes should be implemented carefully to avoid any misinterpretation or parsing errors in the data.

## Questions or Issues

Should you encounter any difficulties or have questions about the data files, do not hesitate to contact the course instructors for assistance:
