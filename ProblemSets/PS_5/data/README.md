# Problem Set 4: Data Directory

Welcome to the data directory for Problem Set 4! This directory is pivotal for the project, housing essential data files used for exercises and tasks within the assignment. These files are instrumental as they provide the necessary input and reference information crucial for the development and testing of your algorithms and implementations.

## Directory Contents

In this directory, you'll find several key files, each containing data relevant to different molecular configurations or scenarios. These include:

- **`C2H4.txt`**: A text file holding data and parameters related to the C2H4 (ethylene) molecule. This file is vital for exercises involving ethylene configurations.
- **`H.txt`**: Contains information or data specific to the hydrogen atom. It's crucial for tasks focused on single hydrogen atom simulations or calculations.
- **`H2.txt`**: This file provides text data and parameters for the H2 (hydrogen) molecule, essential for exercises exploring the hydrogen molecule's properties and behaviors.
- **`HF+.txt`**: A data file pertaining to the hydrogen fluoride ion (HF+). It offers necessary information for tasks that involve this particular ion.
- **`OH.txt`**: Contains data related to the hydroxyl (OH) group. This file is used in exercises where the OH group's properties are of interest.
- **`README.md`**: The present file, detailing the contents of the data directory and providing guidelines for its usage.

## Contributing Data

When adding new data files or modifying existing ones, it is imperative to adhere to the established format. Maintaining a consistent format is essential for ensuring the algorithms that process these files operate correctly and efficiently. Any changes should be approached cautiously to avoid parsing errors or misinterpretation of the data.
